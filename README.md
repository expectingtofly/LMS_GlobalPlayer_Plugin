The Global Player (UK) LMS plugin and all my LMS plugins, are completely free and open source, it has been developed for fun and my own use and with the hope it is useful for others. The plugin is not endorsed by Global.  No donation is expected, however if you find it useful and would like to support the development, you can buy me a coffee via the link below:
